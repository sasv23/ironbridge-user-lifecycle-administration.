## Problem Statement

Ironbridge Bank & Trust is a 160 employee community bank. IT was outsourced to an MSP called VelocIT for five years, and after a regulatory examination the bank was issued a Matters Requiring Attention letter. Finding #1 was the directory.

What I inherited: every account in one flat container with no organizational units, no naming standard, passwords set to never expire, a terminated employee still enabled fourteen months after she left, and a former contractor still holding Domain Admin four years after he left the state.

The bank could not answer the examiners' question: who has access, and why.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the directory was how difficult it was to tell who should have access and why. Active employees, terminated users, service accounts, and unknown accounts were mixed together with no clear structure, which showed me that access had not been consistently managed as people joined, changed roles, or left the bank.

## Solution Overview

I reconciled Active Directory against the HR roster to establish who actually works at the bank, then classified every inherited account as keep, disable, leaver or service.

I designed and built an OU structure by department and branch, created role based security groups from a documented role catalog, and applied a naming standard to every object.

I migrated every surviving account with PowerShell, populating required attributes, granting access through role groups only, and clearing the non-expiring password flag across the bank. I then ran the full identity lifecycle against real tickets: a joiner, a mover, and two leavers.

## Key Work

**Remediated the examination finding.** Disabled the terminated account rather than deleting it, stripped its group memberships, reset the credential, and moved it to a Disabled Users OU with the termination documented on the object.

**Removed an unowned privileged account.** Processed it through a leaver script, dry run first, then live. Removed it from Domain Admins and preserved the account and logs as evidence.

**Answered the Domain Admin question.** Reviewed privileged membership recursively rather than by direct members, because a nested group grants admin rights to everyone inside it.

**Escalated rather than fixed.** Found a separation of duties conflict in the wire transfer workflow, where one person could both initiate and approve a transfer. Funds transfer access is owned by the wire system owner, so I documented it in an exception register and escalated it instead of changing it myself.

**Caught privilege creep in progress.** Processed a role change by adding the new role exactly as requested. The old role was still attached, so I removed it. Requests tell you what to add and never what to remove.

The step I would do differently next time is

## Repository Contents

- `Work/IB-STD-001-Directory-Standard.md` - the directory standard I authored
- `Work/scripts/` - PowerShell for recon, migration, cleanup and evidence
- `Runbook/` - the joiner, mover, leaver SOP this work followed
- `Evidence/` - before and after states, reports, exception register, audit log
- `Logs/` - dry run and live logs for every scripted change
- `screenshots/` - visual evidence at each phase

## What I Learned

**Disable, never delete.**
Every account has a hidden identifier called a SID (Security Identifier), and file permissions, mailbox rights and audit log entries all point at that SID rather than at the name. Delete the account and
<!-- FILL IN: finish the thought. What breaks? What happens if you recreate an account with the same name? -->

**Access belongs on groups, not people.**
A permission granted directly to a user works, but it never shows up in a group membership report, which means
<!-- FILL IN: finish it. What can the bank no longer answer? Tie it back to the examiners' question. -->

**A mover is two operations.**
The request asked me to give her loan processing access. It never mentioned removing her teller access, and

<!-- FILL IN: Add one of your own in the same shape, a bolded line and two or three sentences.
     Pick whatever genuinely got you: the thing that took longest, the mistake you made, or the moment something clicked. -->
